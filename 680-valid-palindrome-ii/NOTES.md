Approach
1. Brute Force
Iterate over each element
Store the left of it and right of it using slicing
add the 2 strings and check if they are pallindrome
​
2. Optimal Approach
Use 2 pointers and check if they are not same then skip_left_char and skip_right_char
return skip_left_char reverse is same or skip_right_char reverse is same
